## A collection of deployment scripts

### Simon, 2020/08/24:

This directory is in dire need of refactoring. It started with script-like python files, but ended up more like a module
like-mutation of interconnected functions and routines.

The main interface for using these scripts is the "application.bat" file includes in copy-pasties. It acts as both a
wrapper for these scripts and as a method to get this all up and running as a submodule. It's a mess.

Started to refactor this bit by bit...
